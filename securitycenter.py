        API for all of the items that match this query and will then
        return the end result back as a single block.  This means that running
        large queries with this function can consume a large amount of memory
        so some care must be taken.

        If any filters need to be specified that cannot simply be expressed as
        filterName=value then you must fully build that specific filter or list
        of filters.  If this is the case, then you must overload the filters
        value with a list of the filter dictionary sets that are needed.  For
        example:

        [{'filterName': FILTERNAME, 'operator': '=', 'value': VALUE}]

        maximum request size that a singular query can consume is 1000
        individual results before rolling on to the next query.
